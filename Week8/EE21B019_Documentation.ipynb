The C-level complex number consists of two components, a real component and an imaginary component, which are stored as consecutive double precision floating-point values in memory.

    "- **FAQ** - Why is main() cpdef ? <br>\n",
    "main() has been kept to be compatible with both C and Python. Thus, it is cpdef(). Making C main() would compel me to take care of return type and would not allow me to use this file alone as a .py file. Making Python main() would compromise speed. Thus, the best plausible solution seemed to be in cpdef main(str name). Contrary to Assignement 2, this main takes in a file name to estimate time. If file name was not taken in as parameter, the timeit function later on would also include the time the user takes to type the file name and the user would need to type the name of the file for each of the 7000 times timeit runs on average. To overcome this difficulty, I have resorted to this method. \n",
    "- The standard Cython wrappers used throughout have also been used to speed up signifcantly such as boundscheck, wraparound, nonecheck and cdivision with appropriate True or False.\n",
    "- Following the golden strategy to optimize - specify data types and make loops C, the main function looks signifantly optimized. The rest is exactly the same as Assignment 2. However, the same is documented here as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be observed that there is significant Python involvement here. This is because the base language involved here is just Python. The pythonic interactions are merely variable assignments, modifications, basic mathematical operations or function call or object creation. All these operations almost take time similar to C as in Python. Thus, more or less, no speed up can be achieved further from the lines in yellow.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a if else statement in Python is structurally similar to a C if else. There may be a slight difference in time, however, this time is insignificant in comparision to the time used in loops."

    "np.ndarray[np.complex128_t, ndim=2] helps in creating M and b which are 2 D Complex matrices. This is needed in this situation to optimize both space and time complexity. Also depending on whether its AC or DC, the dimensions of M and b are set. This is because in MNA, if DC, inductor is short which behaves like a zero volt source and needs one more row in the MNA matrix. This has been accounted for here.\n",

This can be somehow correlated to Amdahl's law in Computer Organization which states that as the number of cores increase, speed up increases.
