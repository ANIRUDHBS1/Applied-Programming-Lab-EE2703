    "\n",
    "The following are the problems you need to solve for this assignment.  You need to submit your code (either as standalone Python script or a Python notebook), a PDF document explaining your solution (either generated from the notebook or a separate LaTeX document), and any supporting files you may have (such as circuit netlists you used for testing your code).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write a function to find the factorial of N (N being an input) and find the time taken to compute it.  This will obviously depend on where you run the code and which approach you use to implement the factorial.  Explain your observations briefly.\n",
    "- Write a linear equation solver that will take in matrices $A$ and $b$ as inputs, and return the vector $x$ that solves the equation $Ax=b$.  Your function should catch errors in the inputs and return suitable error messages for different possible problems.\n",
    "  - Time your solver to solve a random $10\\times 10$ system of equations.  Compare the time taken against the `numpy.linalg.solve` function for the same inputs.\n",
    "- Given a circuit netlist in the form described above, read it in from a file, construct the appropriate matrices, and use the solver you have written above to obtain the voltages and currents in the circuit.  If you find AC circuits hard to handle, first do this for pure DC circuits, but you should be able to handle both voltage and current sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bonus assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "- (Small bonus): after reading in the netlist, allow some or all sources and impedances to be controlled interactively - either using widgets or other mechanisms.  On each change you should recompute the currents and voltages and display them.\n",
    "- (Large bonus): make a solver that can do real-time transient simulations of a SPICE netlist and update the currents and voltages dynamically.  They should also be plotted as a function of time and react to changes.  This is something along the lines of https://www.falstad.com/circuit/.  Ideally you should be able to do a real-time demo of some experiments you might conduct as part of a basic electronics lab, and simulate the behaviour of an oscilloscope and signal generator."
