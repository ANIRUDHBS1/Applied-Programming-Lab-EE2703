# Applied Programming Lab (EE2703) Spring 2023
The repository contains all the assignments and my solutions to the course Applied Programming Lab (EE2703) offered during Jan-May 2023 semester at IIT Madras. The assignments carried a significant 70% of the grade. 

In addition to the assignments, three programming quizzes were conducted which contributed to 20% of the grade.  

There was an in-class programming contest carrying 10% of the grade. We were allowed to code in any programming language. We had to submit the outputs as well as the code immediately after the contest. We were allowed to attempt the contest in groups of atmost three members. 

In addition, there was an optional Project associated with the course. This contributed to **BONUS** marks. Students were asked to come up with an interesting idea, discuss with the Professor and then go about working on the same. Some sample ideas were given in some of the problem statements.
