    "Python is a language that interprets data types differently. It can go about converting from integer to float very easily. Actual division of 12 by 5 gives answer 2.4 and python being a language that juggles around with data types converts 12 (int) and 5 (int) to give 2.4 (float). Languages like C or C++ would have given a result of 2 which is quite intuitive as both the numbers are integers and output also needs to be an integer. "

In case a number divides, we are done, its not prime. If any number does not satisfy also we are done as proved qualitatively here. Suppose you get two divisors of N, both greater than $\\sqrt{N}$, then by definition, the product of the divisors must be N. However, it is quite clear that the product exceeds N and thus, if any divisor exists, it exists in (2, $\\sqrt{N}$)"

So, the first three lines of code in the block essentially translates to f2(f4(x)) which is \"Happy \" + \"nappy \" + x + \"world\" which is \"Happy nappy \" + x + \"world\". Thus when we call f4(\"flappy\") the output is \"Happy nappy flappy world\" as it should be from the explanation given above. "
