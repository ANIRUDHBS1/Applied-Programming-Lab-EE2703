    "## Involved Idea \n",
    "To simulate transients is not easy as described in class. However, I have approached this problem of simulating transients using the s-domain approach using sympy and scipy.signal. Using these powerful libraries of python, I shall convert a given circuit in time domain to s-domain, solve it and retrieve the time-domain transient response of the given circuit. This idea looks novice, but works for any arbitrary networks of R, L and C with independent voltage and current source. The initial conditions of capacitor and inductor have also been accounted for and it is also considered that all sources DC or AC are switched on at t=0 and transients thus obtained are being analysed."

    "- The model assumes that sources are switched on or off at time t = 0. No other time is permitted. This is quite similar to LTSpice in a manner as in LTSpice, sources are permitted to start or stop at t = 0.\n",
    "- If you change resistors or any other elements in the circuit, the transients would be regenerated from t=0 and not the previous stopping instant. \n",
    "- The run_interact button needs to be pressed to register the changes. This cannot be avoided in Jupyter notebook which otherwise could easily have been avoided in the web version by appropriate background web code.\n",
    "- The option for wire has not been provided in the netlist. This will result in the circuit diagram not coming neatly in some cases. This can be added, but has not been added in this version since we were asked to deal with only R,L,C,V and I elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solutions to the above are the use of Javascript to extract data dynamically from the user and generate graphs spontaneously. This is under the domain of Web Development and thus, is beyond the scope of a Python programming course. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make this project similar to the one on Falstad, we would need to integrate this python notebook with appropriate Javascript background, which is seemingly beyond the scope of this course. Notwithstanding that, this is the maximum interactivity offered by Jupyter notebooks. For further improvement in interactivity, a well written Javascript code must be integrated with this notebook to capture values dynamically.\n",
